# Event Management On Move

A decentralized event management system built on Aptos Move that enables event organizers to create and manage events with integrated token rewards and NFT collections.

**This Contract was also used in India Blockchain Week 2024 for Event Management.**

## Overview

Evolv is a comprehensive event management platform that implements a unique dual-token system:
- **Event Tokens (Fungible Assets)**: Each event (Aggregator) has its own token for tracking participant engagement and rewards
- **Event NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens)**: Side events within each main event can issue unique NFTs as rewards for participation and quest completion

## Features

### Core Functionality
- Create and manage main events (Aggregators) with associated ERC20-style tokens
- Launch side events with dedicated NFT collections
- Mint and burn event tokens
- Issue NFT rewards for event participation
- Track event participation and rewards through on-chain events

### Event Structure
- **Main Event (Aggregator)**
  - Unique fungible token for point system
  - Multiple side events
  - Event-specific metadata
  
- **Side Events**
  - Unique NFT collection
  - Uses parent event's token system
  - Custom metadata and reward structure

## Smart Contract Functions

### Event Management
```move
public entry fun create_aggregator(
    evolv_owner: &signer,
    aggregator_name: String,
    aggregator_symbol: String,
    icon_uri: String,
    project_uri: String
)
```
Creates a new main event with its own fungible token.

```move
public entry fun create_side_launch(
    evolv_owner: &signer,
    aggregator_symbol: String,
    side_launch_name: String,
    description: String,
    metadata_uri: String
)
```
Creates a new side event with its NFT collection.

### Token Operations
```move
public entry fun mint_tokens(
    evolv_owner: &signer,
    aggregator_symbol: String,
    to_address: address,
    amount: u64
)
```
Mints event tokens to a participant's address.

```move
public entry fun burn_tokens(
    evolv_owner: &signer,
    aggregator_symbol: String,
    from_address: address,
    amount: u64
)
```
Burns event tokens from a participant's address.

### NFT Management
```move
public entry fun mint_nft(
    evolv_owner: &signer,
    aggregator_symbol: String,
    side_launch_name: String,
    to_address: address
)
```
Mints an NFT reward for a side event participant.

### View Functions
```move
public fun get_aggregator_info(aggregator_symbol: String): Option<AggregatorInfo>
public fun get_side_launch_info(aggregator_symbol: String, side_launch_name: String): Option<SideLaunchInfo>
```
Query event and side event information.

## Event Tracking

The contract emits various events to track system activity:

- `NewAggregatorEvent`: When a new main event is created
- `NewSideLaunchEvent`: When a new side event is launched
- `TokensMintedEvent`: When event tokens are minted
- `TokensBurnedEvent`: When event tokens are burned
- `NftsMintedEvent`: When NFT rewards are issued

## Error Handling

The contract includes comprehensive error handling with specific error codes:

- `ENOT_AUTHORIZED`: Unauthorized operation attempt
- `EAGGREGATOR_NOT_FOUND`: Event not found
- `ESIDE_LAUNCH_NOT_FOUND`: Side event not found
- `EAGGREGATOR_ALREADY_EXISTS`: Duplicate event creation attempt
- `ESIDE_LAUNCH_ALREADY_EXISTS`: Duplicate side event creation attempt

## Architecture

The system follows a hierarchical structure:
1. **Evolv Contract**: Top-level management
2. **Aggregators (Main Events)**: Each with unique fungible tokens
3. **Side Launches**: Associated with aggregators, featuring NFT collections

## Security Considerations

- Owner-only access control for critical operations
- Secure token management with dedicated mint, burn, and transfer references
- Proper validation checks for all operations
- Event emission for transparency and tracking

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up the Aptos development environment
3. Deploy the contract using the Aptos CLI
4. Initialize the contract with the desired owner address
